# cu-freecodecamp-site
A simple site to promote and showcase the projects that we do in the Champaign-Urbana FreeCodeCamp group.

## TODO
- Fix issue where header background attachment isn't fixed on mobile devices.
- Fix header issue where the header image doesn't match the height of the header on smaller screens.
- Add hover effect to projects under the project showcase section.
- Add project information and images to the project showcase section.
- Add social media icons and links to the footer.

## Design
(recommendation) A very common look/feel these days is the Material Design as written by Google. A component library for the web that implements many basic web components with a material design that fits the exact specification can be found at these links

- [material.io](https://material.io/components/web/)
- [material components repo](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web).

## Framework(s)
(recommendation) For now I think it makes sense to keep things simple for people who want to contribute, so keep things (for now) as vanilla javascript, html, and css. No frameworks or libraries, so there is no magic in the code. A new person should be able to understand how our site works by only reading our source code. This may have to change over time as we implement more features and/or API's, but I think it is a good idea to do as much of this site as vanilla as possible.

## Code standards
(recommendation) For now I think it is best to pick a code formatter (like [Beautify](https://github.com/HookyQR/VSCodeBeautify) and just use whatever the default settings. If we as a team decide over time that we want to tweak some of the settings to fit our style as a team then we can create a .jsbeautifyrc file to share in this repo. But for now I think using a default code formatter to try and make all of the code look as similar as possible is ideal. This won't fix all problems but will hopefully catch a lot of spacing/indentation inconsistencies for us.

(recommendation) I think it would also be wise to use an eslint standard, whenever we get around to adding more features that depend on javascript. But for now we can keep most of this project HTML and CSS and avoid having that conversation until needed.
